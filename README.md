# Numerology Horooscope Plus
Numerology Horoscope Plus is an app that updates you on your numerology based on the date which automatically updates each day.  
The date is broken up into 3 sections.  The day, the month and the year.  The app takes each of those dates breaks them up into those three sections and ads each value to one another.  That number then is compared to an index of options in an array and calls that index in the array.
Ofcourse that value given must be subtracted by one in order to be compared to the array because the array index starts at 0 while the values provided from the dates start at 1.
